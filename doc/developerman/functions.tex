\subsection{Standard C Library}

\subsection{Standard C++ Library}

\subsection{Other standard functions}

Some functions and constants that are not provided by both Standard C++ Library and Standard C Library are allowed since they are very useful or are required to get some information about the system and its properties.
Most of these functions and constants are defined by POSIX libraries but are available for a large range of systems and, when not available, are implemented by this library ()
