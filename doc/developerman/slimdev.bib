	Abstract = {Storage and retrieval of multimedia has become a requirement for many contemporary information systems. These systems need to provide browsing, querying, navigation, and, sometimes, composition capabilities involving various forms of media. In this survey, we review techniques and systems for image and video retrieval. We first look at visual features for image retrieval such as color, texture, shape, and spatial relationships. The indexing techniques are discussed for these features. Nonvisual features include captions, annotations, relational attributes, and structural descriptions. Temporal aspects of video retrieval and video segmentation are discussed next. We review several systems for image and video retrieval including research, commercial, and World Wide Web-based systems. We conclude with an overview of current challenges and future trends for image and video retrieval.},

This is true for conventional databases as well as spatial databases, where typical search operations include the point query (find all objects that contain a given search point) and the region query (find all objects that overlap a given search region). More than ten years of spatial database research have resulted in a great variety of multidimensional access methods to support such operations. We give an overview of that work. After a brief survey of spatial data management in general, we first present the class of point access methods, which are used to search sets of points in two or more dimensions. The second part of the paper is devoted to spatial access methods to handle extended objects, such as rectangles or polyhedra. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and experimental results concerning the relative performance of various approaches.},

Our implementation technique is novel, in that it allows us to build sux trees on disk for arbitrarily large sequences, for instance for
the longest human chromosome consisting of 263 million letters. We propose to use such indexes as an alternative to the current practice of serial scanning. We describe our tree creation algorithm, analyse the performance of our index, and discuss the interplay of the data structure with object store architectures. Early measurements are presented.},

By dynamic it is meant that insertions and deletions are intermixed with queries, so that the index cannot be built beforehand. A new data structure, the K-D-B-tree, is presented as a solution to this problem. K-D-B-trees combine properties of K-D-trees and B-trees. It is expected that the multidimensional search efficiency of balanced K-D-trees and the I/O efficiency of B-trees should both be approximated in the K-D-B-tree. Preliminary experimental results that tend to support this are reported.},

	Abstract={Genomic sequence databases are widely used by molecular biologists for homology searching. Amino acid and nucleotide databases are increasing in size exponentially, and mean sequence lengths are also increasing. In searching such databases, it is desirable to use heuristics to perform computationally intensive local alignments on selected sequences and to reduce the costs of the alignments that are attempted. We present an index-based approach for both selecting sequences that display broad similarity to a query and for fast local alignment. We show experimentally that the indexed approach results in significant savings in computationally intensive local alignments and that index-based searching is as accurate as existing exhaustive search schemes.},
