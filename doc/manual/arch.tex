\begin{quote}
  This chapter will describe the archtecture of the Slim-Tree implementation.

\section{Project Specification}

This implementation of the Slim-Tree will replace the first implementation which was
developed by 
Agma J. M. Traina\footnote{ICMC-USP},
Bernard Seeger\footnote{-},
Caetano Traina\footnote{ICMC-USP} and
Christos Faloutsos\footnote{-}. 

...This was copied from presentation. I think this part must be removed in near future...

\section{Basic Archtecture}

This implementation of Slim-Tree is divided in 3 distinct layers, which one with a distinct and
almost independent

\subsubsection{The User Layer}

The main function of this layer is to provide the implementation of the objects and their metric distance functions.


\subsection{The Structure Layer}

This layer holds the definition and the implementation of the metric trees. It
